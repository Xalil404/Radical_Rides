## Business Requirements
Prior to initiating the project's development, user stories were created to give a high level understanding of what the platform's functional requirements will be and they were assigned labels based on their importance using the MoSCoW prioritization method.

The user stories were then placed into a kanban board in order to track the progress of the platform's development.  The Agile development kanban board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/Xalil404/projects/5/views/1).

## Database Schema
After the wire-frames completion, a database schema was created to understand what information should be stored on the back-end database.
