## E-commerce business model & Product Model Canvas
The Radical Rides e-commerce platoform aims to address two issues.  Pain point number 1 is that most surfers, skaters and snowboarders do at least 2 if not all 3 sports, however having to visit 3 different stores is not
convenient.  Also, because the equipment is quite large, most stores have a limited stock which requires the athlete to order the needed board with the store and come back at a later date to pick up the desired board. 

Radical Rides will be the central location for the needs of all 3 sports and should our store not provide the needed board, the user can submit a custom board order right from the website.

## Customer Acquisition
Initial marketing will be focused on creating a Facebook business page since it is the largest social media platform on the market and then utilize Facebook's advertisment campaing features to drive potential customers to our Facebook page and then the e-commerce website.

The second marketing strategy will be to collect user emails via the website which will then be targeted via email marketing campaigns with new product releases, promotions and discounts.

## Business Requirements
Prior to initiating the project's development, user stories were created to give a high level understanding of what the platform's functional requirements will be and they were assigned labels based on their importance using the MoSCoW prioritization method.

The user stories were then placed into a kanban board in order to track the progress of the platform's development.  The Agile development kanban board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/Xalil404/projects/5/views/1).

## Wireframes
Once the user stories were completed, the next phase of the project was to complete the UX of all the expected pages and functionalites in the platform. All wireframes can be found in the designMD file [here](https://github.com/Xalil404/Radical_Rides/blob/main/DESIGN.md).

## Database Schema
After the wire-frames completion, a database schema was created to understand what information should be stored on the back-end database.

## Features 
The Radical Rides e-commerce site consists of the following pages and features:

### Landing Page

The home page of the Radical Rides website displays the website's navigation based on product type with a few custom pages and is followed by a carousel displaying the three main types of boards that the business offers making it clear to potential buyers that the website is a full-service platform for all three sports.

### Products Page

Products can be viewed in three ways, either all the products which the website offers at the same time, products based on a sport category or products based on a sports sub-category.  When viewing numerous products, if the amount of products exceeds 15 products per page, the user will see a pagination feature at the bottom of the page to move onto the next page instead of having a very long scroll, providing a much simpler user experience.

### Product Details Page

The product details page provides all available attributes of information of the product being viewed and also shows a section under the main product of other products which are similar to the prooduct being viewed with an option to visit the similar product's product details page.

### Shopping Bag

A central feature of any e-commerce platform, the shopping bag shows the list of items which the user has added for purchase.  In the shopping bag, the user can increase or decrease the quantity of items they would like to purchase or delete them altogether and remove them from the shopping bag for purchase.

### Liked Products Page

The liked products page is a very handy feature.  Should the user be browsing products casually and is hesitant to add interesting products to the shopping bag because that would indicate an intent to purchase, each product details page has a LIKE button which the user can click and the product is immediately added to the liked or bookmarked products page.  Then at a later time they can visit the liked products page in order to see a summary of all of the produts which they liked on the site and likewise unlike and remove them from that section or click on them to go the product's details page.  The user does not need to be logged in or have an account in order to like products and add them, therefore minimizing the adoption drop rate of using this feature.

### Custom Board Orders Page

Should the website not have a board that meets the exact specifications of a customer, they have the option to visit the custom board orders page and submit a custom board order.  They can specify the board type based on sport, board class, it lenght, width and thickness, image to be printed on the board, select a board color and input any additional notes to the board designer.

### Wish Lists Page

The website consits of a wishlists page.  This feature gives the user the ability to create a wishlit for a specific occasion, add products to it and have it always saved to their profile in order to revisit at a later date and purchase when the needed occasion arrives.  Products in a whislist are daynamic, users can add more products to them or remove products from them.

### Product Reviews Page

Previous customers of Radical Rides products have the option of visiting the product reviews page and submitting a review of a product which they have purchased and can leave on honest review of how they feel about the product's quality with a star rating and text review.  Users have to be logged in to use this feature to avoid spam reviews and so that there is accountability on who wrote the review and the business owner can reach out to users if they were genuinely unhappy about a specific product in order to remedy the siuation.  This feature builds greater trust and transparency amongst potential customers regarding the business' products and offerings.

### Profile Page

The profile page is mainly focused on storing two pieces of information, the user's default deilivery or shipping information and an order history of previous purchases.  When a user fills out their profile delivery information, that information is filled out by default on the order checkout page simplifying the checkout process and providing a smoother user experience.

## Testing
All fucntional testing, user story testing, device compatibility testing and browswer compatibility testing can be found in the [TestingMD](https://github.com/Xalil404/Radical_Rides/blob/main/TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

Deployment of the Radical Rides application required deployment of the web app on 3 platforms: Heroku, ElephantSQL and AWS S3 through the following steps:

* In [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) I created a new instance and copied the new database URL.

* The on [Heroku](heroku.com) I created a new application and in the app's config vars section added the ElephantSQL database URL.

* In my project's settings.py file I installed psycopg2, imported the dj_database_url, commented out the DATABASES section and replaced it with another temporary DATABASES section, migrated the database models to the new database, loaddata-ed the categories, products and created a new superuser. After completing the migration I removed the newly created temporary DATABASES section and uncommented the original DATABASES section, git commited and git pushed my code in order to initiate the deployment.

* Then on AWS I created a new bucket to store static files and configured the bucket's settings. In the bucket's settings, I updated the CORS configuration, enabled ACLs, updated object ownership permissions, generated a bucket policy, created a new group in the Identify and Access Management (IAM) section, attached the newly generated bucket policy to it, and finally retrieved and downloaded the access keys in a CSV file.

* Back in the IDE I added 'storages' to my apps in settings.py and an additional setting to use AWS storage.

* In [Heroku](heroku.com), in the config vars section, I added the AWS retrieved keys and to use AWS and removed the disable collect static variable so that static files would be pushed to S3.  

* Back in the IDE again, I added a custom_storages.py file, imported S3Boto storage and added a media and static storage classes. After committing and pushing the latest changes, I deployed the app again.

* Back in AW S3 I created a media folder, uploaded all the proudct images, granted them public read access and completed the media upload process. 

* Then from the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie) admin interface I retrieved the Stripe public and private keys and added them as config variables in the Heroku app settings.  Also in the Stripe admin dashboard I added the web app's checkout URL in the webhook endpoint URL section and marked it to receive all events. 

* I then copied the Stripe webhook signing secret and added to the config vars in the Heroku settings.
